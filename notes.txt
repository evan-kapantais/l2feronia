About

Welcome to L2 Feronia. We are a small group of friends who used to play Lineage 2 in its golden era. 
During the quarantine, nostalgia hit us hard and we came up with the idea of our own private L2 server. 
The last month we try our best in order to develop and maintain a stable Server without bugs, unbalance classes and stable economy but we can't achieve that without a player base.
As a result, we invite you to join us in l2 Feronia open beta. After the beta test all the characters will be deleted but the accounts which joined during the beta will turn into premium accounts for 1 month.
